The action is a fundamental quantity in Physics. Its origin is in classical
mechanics, used as an alternative formulation of Newtonian mechanics, however
entailed much deeper understanding of the underlying principles natures operates
by.
The action is defined in terms of another quantity called the Lagrangian which is
oddly enough for a given system is defined as $\mathcal{L} = T-V$, with $T$ being 
the kinetic energy and $V$ the potential energy. The action is defined for 
a given trajectory of the system in time and space as the integral of the Lagrangian over
the path in time.

\begin{align}
S = \int_{q_a}^{q_b} \mathcal{L(q,\dot{q},t)} dt 
\end{align}

The action is a functional (function of a function) of the Lagrangian, which can depend on general spatial coordinates $\{q\}$ and their time derivative $\{\dot{q}\}$.

The key and deep insight, is known as the principle of stationary action, which says that a physical system satisfies $\delta S = 0$, i.e. small linear variation to the system's real trajectory are zeroed in the action.

The condition $\delta S$ results in a famous equation, which the Lagrangian is to satisfy, known as the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equation:

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial q} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}.
\end{align}

With this powerful principle, given the write action, one can obtain Maxwell's equations, Einstein General relativity etc.

The simplest example is that of a particle in one dimension under potential $V(x)$. The Lagrangian is given by $\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2 - V$. Plugging it into the EL equation gives $-\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = m\ddot{x}$, which is simply Newton's 2nd law, with the force given by $F=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}$.
