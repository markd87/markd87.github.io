Richard Feynman was one of the greatest minds of the 20th century.
Feynman was the father of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the quantum theory of the Electromagnetic force and light, underpinning most of the modern day technology.

Feynman was a unique character. His passion, curiosity, and ability to explain complex topics as reveled in interviews and books (e.g. Surely you are joking mr. Feynman) were second to none. Feynman, among others was the reason I decided to study physics. The idea that the universe holds a hidden truth, which can be expressed with the language of mathematics and is waiting to be discovered and understood by us was highly compelling and meaningful for me to pursue on whatever small scale.

"Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough."

I came across this tweet showing a slide from a presentation by Prof. Roxanne Springer in the APS April, titled "How to do physics like Feynman".

### Confusion = opportunity

- Indulge in the joy of discovery
- Embrace uncertainty and doubt
- See every problem as an opportunity
- Be curious about everything

### Work very very hard

- Love the details
- Think constantly
- Focus deeply

### Question authority

- Employ strict integrity
- Chart your own path
- Work everything out in your own way
- Stop worrying about what everybody else thinks

I find this list to be incredibly concise, deep, inspiring and useful to follow. Even more importantly I think this list is equally applicable to any research oriented field, profession or project worth pursuing in general.
Although these points are much easier to write than to actually follow, they can still be used as a framework and constant reminder of what it takes to succeed and innovate.

Additionally, I think that these bullet points can be readily identified in the way other great individuals that have made important contributions lived or live their lives.
