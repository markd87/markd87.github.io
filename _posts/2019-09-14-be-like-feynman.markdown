### Confusion = opportunity
  * Indulge in the joy of discovery
  * Embrace uncertainty and doubt
  * See every problem as an opportunity
  * Be curious about everything

### Work very very hard
* Love the details
* Think constantly
* Focus deeply

### Question authority
  * Employ strict integrity
  * Chart your own path
  * Work everything out in your own way
  * Stop worrying about what everybody else thinks

I came across this tweet showing a slide from a presentation by Prof. Roxanne Springer in the APS April, titled "How to do physics like Feynman".

I find this list to be incredibly concise, deep, inspiring and useful to follow. Even more importantly I think these list is equally applicable to any research oriented field, profession or project worth pursuing in general.
Although these points are much easier to write than to actually follow, they can still be used as a framework and constant reminder of what it takes to succeed and innovate. 

Additionally, I think that these bullet points can be readily identified in the way other great individuals that have made important contributions lived or live their lives.
