      <h2>A short biography</h2>
      <p class='lead'>
        I was born in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irkutsk'>Irkutsk</a>, Russia. When I was 3 years old my family moved to Israel. In Israel I lived in Haifa for a few years, and then moved to Jerusalem where I spent most of my life, going to primary school and high school. At the age of 18 I was recruited to the Israeli army where I served in the navy for 3 years, both at sea on a <a href='http://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Super-Dvora-MK3-at-48-knots-6-Planing-IAI.jpg'>combat ship</a> and on land. Immediately after finishing my army service, I started studying Physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I had the great pleasure and honour of learning from great physicists such as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Shaviv'>Nir Shaviv</a>, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bekenstein'>Jacob Bekenstein</a> to name a few, and the mathematician <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Lawrence'>Ruth Lawrence</a>. After the first year of studies I received the dean's prize and joined the university's honours program called 'Amirim'. During my studies I also worked at the computational quantum Chemistry centre at the University, doing small computational projects and being responsible of the centre and director's (Prof. Sason Shaik) websites. At the time, I was particularly interested in Astrophysics and Cosmology and I chose my research project for the bachelor's degree to be in the field of galaxy formation studies using cosmological simulations. After graduating I naturally continued my research in the same field with my advisor Prof. Avishai Dekel for the master's degree, titled "on the origin of angular momentum in galaxies". Following the master's degree, I decided to switch my interest to the field of condensed matter and Nanoscience. I wanted to experience life abroad so I started looking for PhD positions in various universities in Europe and USA, and was accepted to work with Prof. Vladimir Fal'ko at Lancaster University, UK. Following the first year we moved to the national graphene institute at the University of Manchester, where I am today. There I have the great privilege to work alongside the two Nobel laureates Konstantin Novoselov and Andrei Geim, as well as other visiting theoreticians and experimentalists.
        <br/>
      </p>


      <p class='lead'>
        &bullet; On 14/03/2018 I successfully defended my PhD thesis and passed the viva examination.
<br>
<br>
        &bullet; Following the completion of the PhD I will be working as a strategic consultant - data science at <a href='https://www.amey.co.uk/strategic-consulting/'>Amey</a> (named after its founder <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amey_plc'>William Charles Amey</a>), where data science is used to maintain, operate and improve the infrastructure around the UK and abroad.
        The infrastructure industry is normally considered as old and outdated despite its significant impact on the economic growth of any society, directly affecting the way people live, work and travel.
        As such utilizing the tools of data science and machine learning to the problems facing this industry can lead to significant improvements and innovation.<br>
        The job application process with Amey strategic consulting involved a phone interview followed by a take-home data analysis and report writing exercises followed by a whole day assessment centre attended by ~15 candidates and senior members of the Amey strategic consulting team. The day included another data analysis exercise, interview and a group activity.

      <h2>Work and achievements</h2>
      <p class='lead'>
        &bullet; During my time at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, working with the computational quantum Chemistry centre, I contributed to a paper on no-pair bonding of high-spin Copper clusters, calculating bond lengths, and energies <a target='_blank' href='http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp055125a'>[paper]</a>.
        <br/>
        &bullet; During my BSc studies, I've received the Dean's prize for the first year of studies, and appeared on the Dean's list for all three years. For my BSc degree project as part of the 'Amirim' program, I worked on the filamentary structure of the cosmic web in the early universe <a target='_blank' href='http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/422/2/1732'>[paper]</a>.
        <br/>
        &bullet; For my MSc  <a target='_blank' href='master_thesis.pdf'>thesis</a>, I studied the angular momentum acquisition of disc galaxies through the filaments of the cosmic web and published a 
        <a target='_blank' href='http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/449/2/2087'>paper</a> which was in the top 1% of the academic field of Space Science based on a highly cited threshold for the field and publication year</a>.
        <br/>
        &bullet; During my MSc studies I also worked as a postgraduate teaching assistant, primarily grading homework assignments for undergraduate Physics courses.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A few other works from my time at the Hebrew University: <br/>
        &bullet; Final project in the physics with computers graduate course. The code was written in Fortran, and the plots were made using Matlab. <a href='final_paper_hydro.pdf' target='_blank'>2D Hydrodynamics of an incompressible fluid with viscosity in steady state</a>.
        <br/>
        &bullet; The final assignment in the Quantum Field Theory 2 graduate course. Calculating the one loop correction in QED to the electron g-factor. <a href='qft2paper.pdf' target='_blank'>[PDF]</a> (in Hebrew).

       <h2>Other Interests</h2>
       <p class='lead'>
          In addition to my scientific work and interests, I also enjoy expanding my knowledge in other subjects and fields. 
          Two particular interests of mine are web development and data science.
          Both are of great practical use and also fun considering the things one can achieve.
          As such over the years I've gained experience in: HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL.<br/>
          I discovered the field of data science and machine learning more recently, noticing the overall hype, and its wide range of applications in various fields. I decided it would be useful and beneficial to gain some practical knowledge in the field. <br/>
          I learn and apply data science techniques with Python, and its various data science and machine learning libraries including <a href='http://scikit-learn.org/'>scikit-learn</a> and <a href='http://pandas.pydata.org/'>pandas</a>.<br/>

        <h2>Various</h2>
          <p class='lead'>
          &bullet; A <a href='http://science-poetry.com/poem.php?pid=589'>poem</a> I wrote for a science oriented poetry competition at the University of Manchester.
          <br>
          &bullet; A <a href="http://www.markdanovich.com/places.html" target="_blank">world map</a> with places I've visited.
          <br>
          &bullet; The picture on the home page was taken during a hike in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees' target='_blank'>Pyrenees</a>, on the Spanish side.
          <br>
          &bullet; The quote on the picture is from Pink Floyd's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrojrDCI02k' target='_blank'>Breathe</a>, the second song from the "Dark side of the moon" album.
          <br>
          &bullet; The favicon <img src='img/pale.ico' width='50px'> showing three coloured beams on a dark background, is the famous pale blue dot picture, showing earth as a tiny dot suspended in a beam of light. It was taken by Voyager 1 from a distance of 6 billion kilometres due to the suggestion by Carl Sagan that such a picture would be worthwhile to take. Voyager 1 is currently 20 billion kilometres from Earth, travelling in interstellar space. The name for the photo was given by Carl Sagan and accompanying it was this inspiring and humbling <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmP4Xzt0rN4' target='_blank'>speech</a>.

          &bullet; For a long time I had a real fascination with classical music, it was my favourite genre and I practically listened only to classical music. Nowadays I still enjoy classical music, but not as exclusively as I did. My passion for classical music and the great composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Bach and Chopin, inspired me to try and learn to play the piano. My dream was to be able to play a Chopin piece. So I took weekly lessons for a few months, and since a piano is quite a large instrument, I didn't have one, and most of my practising was during the lessons and in a hotel building which had a conference room with a piano in it that was mostly not used. Unfortunately, not being able to practice daily eventually made me stop the lessons. My only memory from that time is this recording of me playing during a practice session in which I practice pieces by Chopin, Bach and Mozart.<br>
