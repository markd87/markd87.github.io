Given a repeated set of $n$ independent experiments $X_i$ with $s$ sucesses ($X_i=1$), what is the probabibility of the $n+1$ experiment being a success:

$$
P(X_{n+1}=1|\sum_{i=1}^{n} {X_i}=s) = \frac{s+1}{n+2}
$$

This is known as Laplace's [Rule of Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_succession).
