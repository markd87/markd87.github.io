It is not obvious why the industrial revolution happened when and where it did (19th century England).
Robert C. Allen's theory's main point is that the high-wages of human labour in England and relatively cheap energy, resulted in technical innovation aimed primarily at reducing human labour in favour of machinery to save on costs.
A good overview and some thoughts [here](https://pseudoerasmus.com/2016/12/01/allen).
