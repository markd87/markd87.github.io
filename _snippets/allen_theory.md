It is not obvious why did the industrial revolution happened when and where it did (19th century England).
Robert C. Allen's theory's main point is that the high-wages of human labour in England and relatively cheap energy resulted in technical innovation aimed primarily at reducing human labour in favour of machinery to save on costs.
