<p>Music is a very pure manifestation of nature and the laws of physics. The way sound is generated, using any instrument, boils down to creating waves of high and low air pressure with a given frequency which originate at the instrument and reach our ears.</p>

<p>I particularly like the piano for its overall beauty of design, the way the sound is generated in an acoustic piano, the black and white keys triggering a hammer, which hits a string with a given length, which in turn determines the key’s sound.
Additionally, the piano demonstrates the elegance of the human hand and fingers, their flexibility, dexterity and fluency.
Why is it that certain sound are almost universally pleasant whereas others feel dissonant, and why is it that certain combination of notes feel harmonious, and evoke universal emotions of happiness or sadness is an interesting question, which may have evolutionary roots.</p>

<p>I’ve recently purchased a Kawai es110 electric piano, which has 88 weighted keys and sounds individually sampled from an acoustic grand piano, making it the closest I could get to a real acoustic piano at a reasonable price and size. So I’m back pursuing my side dream of learning the piano, for now I’m using an app, which didn’t exist at the time called FlowKey, which allows to practice the piano and getting feedback while playing, which is quite cool.</p>
