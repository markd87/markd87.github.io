  <div class="post-content">
      I was born in Irkutsk, Russia. When I was 3 years old my family moved to Israel.
      In Israel I lived in Haifa for a few years, and then moved to Jerusalem where I 
      spent most of my life, going to primary school and high school. At the age of 18 
      I was recruited to the Israeli army where I served in the navy for 3 years, both 
      at sea on a combat ship and on land. 
      <br/><br/>
      Immediately after finishing my army service, I started studying Physics at the 
      Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I had the great pleasure and honour of learning from great physicists such as Nir Shaviv, and
      Jacob Bekenstein to name a few, and the mathematician Ruth Lawrence. After the first
      year of studies I received the dean's prize and joined the university's honours program 
      called 'Amirim'. During my studies I also worked at the computational quantum Chemistry 
      centre at the University, doing computational projects and being responsible of 
      the centre and director's (Prof. Sason Shaik) websites. 
      <br/><br/>      
      At the time, I was particularly interested in Astrophysics and Cosmology and I chose my 
      research project for the bachelor's degree to be in the field of galaxy formation studies 
      using cosmological simulations. 
      After graduating I naturally continued my research in the same field with my advisor 
      Prof. Avishai Dekel for the master's degree, titled "on the origin of angular momentum 
      in galaxies". 
      <br/><br/>
      Following the Master's degree, I decided to switch my interest to the field
      of condensed matter and Nanoscience. I wanted to experience life abroad as well so I started looking
      for PhD positions in various universities in Europe and USA. I was accepted to work 
      with Prof. Vladimir Fal'ko at Lancaster University, UK in September 2014. Following the 
      first year we moved to the National Graphene Institute (NGI) at the University of Manchester. 
      There I had the great privilege to work alongside the two Nobel laureates Konstantin Novoselov 
      and Andrei Geim,as well as other visiting theoreticians and experimentalists.
      <br><br>
      On 14/03/2018 I successfully defended my PhD thesis. Following my PhD and academic life,
      I decided to pursue a career in data science, and started working as a consultant at 
      Amey Strategic Consulting working on data science projects related to infrastructure in the UK.
