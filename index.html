Hi, I'm Mark, a Physicist and Data Scientist currently working as a Data Science
Consultant for Amey Strategic Consulting, improving the way people live, work
and travel through data. I was Born in Russia, grew up in Israel, and currently
(October, 2020) living and working in London, UK.
My purpose in writing a blog is mainly as a way to organize and have a personal reference to knowledge, ideas and general thoughts.
Writing about a topic requires a more structured and critical thinking than simply rehearsing it in my head and then potentially forgetting it.
This structural thinking helps make the thoughts clearer and reveal any gaps in the understanding.
