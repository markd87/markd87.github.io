I was born in Irkutsk, Russia. When I was 3 years old my family moved to Israel.
In Israel I lived in Haifa for a few years, and then moved to Jerusalem where I 
spent most of my life, going to primary school and high school. At the age of 18 
I was recruited to the Israeli army where I served in the navy for 3 years, both 
at sea on a combat ship and on land. 

Immediately after finishing my army service, I started studying Physics at the 
Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I had the great pleasure and honour of learning from great physicists such as Nir Shaviv, and
Jacob Bekenstein to name a few, and the mathematician Ruth Lawrence. After the first
year of studies I received the dean's prize and joined the university's honours program 
called 'Amirim'. During my studies I also worked at the computational quantum Chemistry 
centre at the University, doing computational projects and being responsible of 
the centre and director's (Prof. Sason Shaik) websites. 

At the time, I was particularly interested in Astrophysics and Cosmology and I chose my 
research project for the bachelor's degree to be in the field of galaxy formation studies 
using cosmological simulations. 
After graduating I naturally continued my research in the same field with my advisor 
Prof. Avishai Dekel for the master's degree, titled "on the origin of angular momentum 
in galaxies". 

Following the Master's degree, I decided to switch my interest to the field
of condensed matter and Nanoscience. I wanted to experience life abroad as well so I started looking
for PhD positions in various universities in Europe and USA. I was accepted to work 
with Prof. Vladimir Falko at Lancaster University, UK in September 2014. Following the 
first year we moved to the National Graphene Institute (NGI) at the University of Manchester. 
During my PhD I studied two-dimensional material for optoelectronic applications. These involved understanding the theory behind the electronic and optical properties of these materials, and how these can be applied in actual devices such as photo-detectors, transistors, light emitters etc.
At the NGI I had the great privilege to work alongside the two Nobel laureates Prof. Konstantin Novoselov 
and Prof. Andrei Geim, as well as other visiting theoreticians and experimentalists.

On 14/03/2018 I successfully defended my PhD thesis. 
My [PhD Thesis](../assets/PhD_Thesis_final_MARK_DANOVICH.pdf) titled "Optoelectronics of Two Dimensional Transision Metal Dichalcogenides" .

Following my PhD and academic life,
I decided to pursue a career in data science, and started working as a consultant at 
Amey Strategic Consulting working on data science projects related to infrastructure in the UK.
